# Dev Log

## Initial setup

2023-03-06

I scaffolded a VueJS project and edited the components to get to a starting point for the project.

Also I went ahead and started to edit the template code and styles to create the Cell and Grid components.

To get a deep understabding of modern CSS using the Grid and Flex Box, I studied [Web.dev Learn CSS](https://web.dev/learn/css) which is a great tutorial site.

I considered all of the presentation needs that I wanted to be able to produce in a grid cell such as:

* One big number
* A pair or one candidate number
* A grid of 9 candidate numbers
* A sum value for a Killer Sudoku group
* Coloring the elements

At this stage, all of these requirements have been realized, and I can move onto thinking about how to control the cell and implement the reactive data for the state of the puzzle.

Also, I need to initialze GIT and create a repository for the code.
